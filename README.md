# KOS-provenance-LLM
This is the public repository for the data used in our study about KOS provenance and LLMs. 

## Dewey Exhibit Data 
The data we used is from the Dewey Decimal Classification Editoral Committee, originally located in their google drive. The five exhibit files we used can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/yiyunyc2/KOS-provenance-LLM/tree/58d9a31d76cb2cd70d4b9ebd35884650e4a9efa3/Dewey%20Exhibits). This includes the exhibit we used as ground truth data, and the four other exhibits we used for the experiments.  

## Replay the experiments
To replay the experiments to extract provenance (warrant) information from the DDC exhibit, please refer to these two sections in this repo:
